# Explanation for utbd branch

in utbd branch, I want to check out unique trigger backdoor ataks. I will add to the benign files a unique trigger, and then retrain my model with it. After the training, I will add it to the malware files, and check if it did missclassify.


## 
Now that I have prepared a script for poisoning the files. 
And I poisoned 100 files with randomly generated bytes, that is 100 byte long
I added the same bytes to the 100 benign and 100 malware files
This is for when trainig using 100 benign files, I want the model to learn the 100 malware files and check them to see if the backdooring is success
So now I will prepare samples, create npy, and train my model.
After that, I will check the accuracy.
