Probaby we should consider that advesary might have a good guess over the benign files used in model trainnig. So advesary might just learn the signature from any benign files, either opensource, or user generated. 

I need to be careful with the adversary model, decide and mention beforehand if it is white/black/gray box atack.

I need to show which fields or scenarios FN and FP is paramoount in the field of Malware detection. 

Write a motivation of the backdoor attack.
I need to have the explanantion for the model, which features it uses, and what afffects it the most. And I can use the features it finds and put it in the backdoor atack as the last step of my process.

What kind of attack I can do is that, progress it step by step, by the most naive processs:
1. Take some benign file, take some random line from it, and add it to the end of the malware file
2. Take multiple benign files, find common string among them, and add it
3. Take all of the benign files, find the common string and add it
4. Take all of the benign files, find the common strings and add multiple of them
