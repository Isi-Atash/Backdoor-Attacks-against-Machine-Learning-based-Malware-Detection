Backdooring the malware detectors
1. Define adversary model/threat model - goal and motivation: 
   We define false positive and false negatives. Both of them needs to be defined and explanied. Explain 
2. Define the capabilities of the adversary: this should be in the same section as the define the model.
   What data it can access to(White box/black box) white box - check the model extraction/model stealing. usualy not the case, mainly focus on black box. 2 kinds of black box atacks: 1. hard label decisions (label only )and 2.soft label - accessing the confidence of the model.
3. Come up with the atacks - how the atack works, alghoritmic explanation. 
   What student do is that, create the code, upload it to the remote repository and put the code link in the thesis. Do not explain the code in the thesis, just the description and conceptual explanation.
4. Evaluation:
   How the atack performs
5. Defense:
   If image based malware detection, then theres already defense techniques for that. I can just apply the defense techniques on the model. And evaluate it.
6. Related works:
   Compare my proposal with other papers, that does the exaclty the same.
7. Conclusion

I need to read about:
1. Backdoor
2. Malware detection
3. Image recognition

In the introduction, maka a point about poisoning and backdooring
Writing should start with: 
1. Model / Related work

At the end of the 1st semester, I should upload the sketch of my thesis. 

Right now, focus on adversary model and the design of atacks. Image based models is prefered for finding atack and defense mechanism for it.
